## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Build the project:**
```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

### Web Interface (Recommended)

#### Development Environment
For development with hot-reload and file watching:
```bash
# Build and start development server
npm run build
npm run pm2:dev

# Access web UI at http://localhost:3002
```

Development PM2 commands:
```bash
npm run pm2:restart:dev  # Restart dev server
npm run pm2:stop:dev     # Stop dev server
npm run pm2:logs:dev     # View dev logs
```

#### Production Environment
For production deployment:
```bash
# Build and start production server
npm run build
npm run pm2:prod

# Access web UI at http://localhost:3001
```

Production PM2 commands:
```bash
npm run pm2:restart:prod # Restart prod server
npm run pm2:stop:prod    # Stop prod server
npm run pm2:logs:prod    # View prod logs
```

#### PM2 Management
```bash
npm run pm2:status       # Check status of all processes
npm run pm2:delete       # Delete all processes (dev & prod)
pm2 monit               # PM2 monitoring dashboard
```

### Direct Node.js Usage

#### Running the Scheduler with Web UI
Start both the scheduler and web interface:
```bash
npm start
# or
node dist/index.js daemon
```

#### Running Web UI Only
Start just the web interface without the scheduler:
```bash
node dist/index.js web
```

### CLI Commands

#### Account Management
```bash
node dist/index.js account list              # List all accounts
node dist/index.js account add               # Add a new account (interactive)
```

#### Post Management
```bash
node dist/index.js add "Your post content" --delay 2    # Schedule post 2 hours from now
node dist/index.js list                                 # List scheduled posts
node dist/index.js list --pending                       # Show only pending posts
node dist/index.js delete <post-id>                     # Delete a post
```

## Web Interface Guide

### Notes View
- **Create Notes**: Organize your content into reusable notes
- **Schedule Posts**: Schedule single or multiple posts from each note
- **Track Progress**: See published and upcoming posts for each note
- **Batch Scheduling**: Set custom intervals and repetition counts

### Quick Schedule
- **Instant Posting**: Create and publish content immediately
- **Live Preview**: See formatted output with media previews
- **Media Support**: Automatic image and video embedding
- **Smart Formatting**: Hashtag and mention highlighting

### Account Management
- **Multiple Accounts**: Manage multiple Nostr identities
- **Publishing Methods**: 
  - **Direct**: Publish directly to relays using stored keys
  - **API**: Use external API endpoints for publishing
  - **NostrMQ**: Message queue-based publishing
- **Secure Storage**: Private keys stored in macOS Keychain

## Configuration

### Publishing Methods

#### Direct to Relays
- Stores private key (nsec) securely in macOS Keychain
- Publishes directly to specified Nostr relays
- Most reliable and decentralized option

#### API Publishing
- Posts to configured HTTP endpoint
- Requires npub for remote signer integration
- Default: `http://localhost:3000/post/note`

#### NostrMQ
- Uses Nostr protocol for message queuing
- Requires npub and target NostrMQ service
- Advanced option for specialized setups

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Optional configuration
PORT=3001                                    # Web server port
NODE_ENV=production                         # Environment mode
```

### Database Schema
- **notes**: Content storage with account association
- **accounts**: Nostr account configurations and publishing methods
- **posts**: Scheduled posts linked to notes with timing and status

### PM2 Deployment Setup

**Development (`ecosystem.dev.config.cjs`)**:
- Process name: `fcdev`
- Port: `3002`
- Uses `tsx` for TypeScript hot-reload
- Watches `src/` directory for changes
- Optimized for development workflow

**Production (`ecosystem.config.cjs`)**:
- Process name: `fcprod`  
- Port: `3001`
- Uses compiled `dist/index.js`
- Stable production configuration
- Resource-optimized settings

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **PostScheduler**: Cron-based scheduler (runs every 5 minutes)
- **WebServer**: Express server with REST API and web UI
- **PostDatabase**: SQLite database wrapper for posts, notes, and accounts
- **Publisher**: Multi-method publishing system (API, NostrMQ, Direct)
- **KeychainService**: Secure key storage using macOS Keychain

### Data Flow
1. **Note Creation**: User creates note with content
2. **Post Scheduling**: One or more posts scheduled from note
3. **Publishing**: Scheduler picks up due posts and publishes via configured method
4. **Status Tracking**: Real-time status updates and error handling

The application maintains a clean separation between content (notes) and scheduling (posts), allowing for flexible reuse and management of Nostr content.
